Unify WPML translation versions of a crowdfunding campaign so that contributions to each language version count towards the main campaign.

== Description ==

If you are running a multi-lingual crowdfunding website and you want a single campaign to have multiple language versions, this is the plugin you need. It works alongside WPML and Appthemer Crowdfunding, ensuring that when you have created translations of your campaign, contributions to each language-specific version of the campaign count towards the same campaign. 

This plugin requires zero configuration. Just install it and you're done.

**Requirements**

* Appthemer Crowdfunding 1.7+
* WPML 2.9+
* Easy Digital Downloads 1.8+
* Wordpress 3.7+ (will probably work with earlier versions, but support will not be provided for older installations)

**Compatible Themes**

While this theme should work with any theme created with Appthemer Crowdfunding, we have personally tested it with our premium crowdfunding theme:

* [Franklin Crowdfunding Theme](http://themeforest.net/item/franklin-wordpress-crowdfunding-theme/5063650?ref=Studio164a) — A stylish crowdfunding theme for community-oriented crowdfunding sites like Kickstarter or Indiegogo, or for self-hosted single-campaign websites. 

== Installation == 

1. Upload All-in-one WPML Crowdfunding Campaigns to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**Can people create multilingual campaigns via the frontend submission form with this plugin?**

No, not currently. At this stage, the only way for people to create multi-lingual campaigns is via the Wordpress dashboard. If there is sufficient demand for this, we may look at creating a PRO version of this plugin that adds this ability.
